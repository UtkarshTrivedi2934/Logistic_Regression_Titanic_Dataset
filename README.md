# Logistic_Regression_Titanic_Dataset

Features:

The Titanic dataset is a famous dataset used in machine learning and statistics for various classification and predictive modeling tasks, including Logistic Regression. It contains information about the passengers on the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived or not. This dataset is often used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on a set of features.

Here are some of the common features found in the Titanic dataset:

Passenger Class (Pclass): The class of the passenger (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
Name: The name of the passenger.
Sex: The gender of the passenger.
Age: The age of the passenger.
Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp): The number of siblings or spouses aboard.
Parents/Children Aboard (Parch): The number of parents or children aboard.
Ticket: The ticket number.
Fare: The fare paid for the ticket.
Cabin: The cabin number.
Embarked: The port at which the passenger embarked (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
The target variable is typically "Survived," which indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the sinking of the Titanic.
